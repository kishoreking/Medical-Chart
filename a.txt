Things to build for prototype:

Background - InventHealth is building a coder workbench where medical coders log-in and work on the medical charts (PDF) assigned to them. 
You need to make sure that the work allocation is automated and medical coders do not sit idle if there are charts to be 
worked on.

Create a chart / task allocation functionality for medical coders with the following constraints:
You have 5 medical coders
You have 150 medical charts
A chart can be in one of the following statuses:
Unassigned - Chart is not assigned to any medical coder so far and can be considered for allocation
In Queue - The chart is assigned to a medical coder but has not started working on it
In Progress - The coder is actively working on that chart
Completed - Coder has completed working on that chart
Hold - The coder has put the chart on hold to get queries addressed
Each coder can have a maximum of 10 medical charts in the queue
Chart assignment must be even across all coders

Data and Tech Specs:
Feel free to use the stack you like as long as the work is done in Python. Though we prefer flask, for the interview 
we do not have the compulsion 
to use flask
Create a database of your choice. We are using MongoDB. But you are free to use database of your choice for the 
interview
Create the dummy data based on your understanding. It is important to know which chart is assigned to a specific 
coder and 
its corresponding status

When presenting the solution, focus on the following points:
The logical flow of assignment
Your database schema and model
Front-end is not too important for the demo, but a simple working front-end would be nice to see

User-5(max-10 chart in queue)
chart-150(Unassigned,InQueue,InProgress,Completed, Hold)
